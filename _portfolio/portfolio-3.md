# Songs for Giants (2023)

SONGS FOR GIANTS is a short interactive essay on lyric games built in Twine, Bitsy, Tracery, P5.js, Python, and Glitch and hosted on itch.io. This essay weaves together personal anecdotes, myth, minigames, and scholarship to paint an opaque portrait of an analog microgame scene and the playful obscenity of games-that-are-not-games. The final chapter also includes several janky tools for creating your own unplayable gamesâ€”such as the One Page RPG Generator. Songs for Giants was peer-reviewed and featured in the Console-Ing Passions: Feminist Media Conference Arcade in 2022. Songs for Giants may be played at: [https://gravesnail.itch.io/songs-for-giants](https://gravesnail.itch.io/songs-for-giants).
